            What Me Worry? Please replace the image above and introduce yourself.
            Explore your editor and find out what features it has for
            helping you write HTML. Feel free to use any HTML tags you
            come across.
            In your introduction, answer the following questions:
            <ul>
                <li>What is your name?</li>
                <li>What is your major?</li>
                <li>Have you done any web development before?</li>
                <li>What do you hope to get out of this course?</li>
                <li>Which editors did you try and which did you settle on (for now)?</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            When you're done, submit a link to your page on github via
            the elearn dropbox. If you have any problems, don't stress. Talk
            to me before class next week and we'll go through it again.
